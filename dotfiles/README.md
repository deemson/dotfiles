# deemson dotfiles

dotfiles are organized per-OS/per-app that I use
- [shared](./shared) - contains app dotfiles that are used on all OS'
- [macos](./macos) - contains macos-related dotfiles
- [linux](./linux) - contains linux-related dotfiles
- [uncategorized](./uncategorized) - various stuff either highly specific and/or with low rate of change for which I don't see a point of automating saving/loading

## Shared Apps

- [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - text editor
- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) - shell
- [ghostty](http://ghostty.org/) - super sleek terminal emulator; worth mentioning that it's not in the shared folder as configurations for linux & mac are different
- [starship](https://starship.rs/) - pretty terminal prompt

## Linux Apps

- [sway](https://swaywm.org/) - tiliing window manager for Linux (Wayland)
